# digital_ic_design_workshop
This repository is to present my learning of digital ic  design based on FPGA and ASIC. 

### WEEK 1 ACTIVITIES: Learning Verilog HDL
-- Language fundamentals
-- Types of modelling
<ol>
  <li>Switch level modelling</li>
    <li>Gate level modelling</li>
    <li>Dataflow level modelling</li>
    <li>Behavorial level modelling</li>
    <li>Structural level modelling</li>
</ol>

-- Switch level modelling
<p allign="justify">In this we have switch level primitives such as nmos, pmos, for power supply we have keywords such as supply1,supply0. This modelling is used only for simulation purposes. This is not supported by the synthesizer tools.</p>
